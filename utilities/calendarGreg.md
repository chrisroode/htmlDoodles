Calendar Greg is a tool to quickly make a calendar HTML table that can be copy/pasted into your favorite word processor.  It offers simple formatting options, and is intended to help bypass more tedious wizards presented in today's software suites.

To use this utility:
1) Copy the HTML file 'calendarGreg.html' into a folder on your computer.
2) Open it in google Chrome browser (or your default browser)
3) Use the Year, Height and Width boxes to adjust the calendar settings.
4) The select button will select the entire year's calendar.  Copy with right click or ctrl/command-C.  Then paste it wherever you want to put it.

If you want to start in a month other than January, or end in a month other than December, just paste and delete what you don't need.
